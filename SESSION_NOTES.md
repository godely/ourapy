# Session Notes - Rolling Development Log

## Session 2025-06-21 (Current)
**Context**: Working on Task #5A - Time-series data field corrections

### Recent Accomplishments
1. **Documentation Optimization**:
   - Updated README.md with current features (15+ endpoints, error handling, retry logic)
   - Added Reference Files section to CLAUDE.md (openapi_spec.json, etc.)
   - Optimized ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT_STATE.md (removed resolved issues)

2. **Time-Series Data Analysis**:
   - Verified OpenAPI spec structure: SampleModel {interval: number, items: array, timestamp: string}
   - Identified incorrectly assumed time-series fields that should remain Optional[str]
   - Confirmed actual time-series fields: met, heart_rate, hrv, motion_count in various models

3. **Process Improvements**:
   - Implemented meta-documentation approach: iterate and optimize rather than accumulate
   - Established reference file documentation pattern

### Key Learning
**Meta-Documentation Principle**: Documentation files should be living documents that evolve - remove resolved issues, keep architectural decisions, optimize for current state.

### Current Status
- **MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Comprehensive API audit revealed systemic issues beyond Task #5A
- **Critical Issues Found**:
  1. Heart Rate endpoint: Uses `start_date`/`end_date` but spec requires `start_datetime`/`end_datetime`
  2. VO2 Max URL: `/vo2_max` vs spec's `/vO2_max` 
  3. Inconsistent API patterns: Old vs new implementations mixed
  4. Undocumented `Union[str, date]` type used across 20+ files
  5. Missing field hypnogram_5_min doesn't exist in OpenAPI spec
- **TimeSeriesData**: Fixed timestamp→int, interval→int, added conversion logic
- **Next Priority**: Complete systematic audit and fix all spec mismatches

## Previous Sessions (Summary)
- **Task 1-3**: Foundation work, data model standardization
- **Error Handling**: 2+ months of development, comprehensive retry system
- **API Discovery**: Real-world testing revealed model discrepancies

## Next Session Startup Template
1. Read PROJECT_STATE.md for current branch/task status
2. Check ARCHITECTURE.md for technical context
3. Review recent SESSION_NOTES for immediate context
4. Avoid "where were we?" token waste
