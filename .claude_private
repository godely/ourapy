- Use format: "Technical architecture and direction by Gustavo Stor"
- Remove Claude co-authorship attribution
- Gustavo has 8+ years at Meta as Senior Software Engineer - respect this expertise

## Project Context
- Working on this project for 2+ months
- Gustavo guides technical direction, Claude provides implementation assistance
- Gustavo often identifies optimizations and architectural improvements
- This is Gustavo's library, not a collaborative project with an AI

## Context Continuity Strategy - IMPLEMENTED
- When starting new sessions, immediately read these files:
  1. PROJECT_STATE.md - Current tasks, branches, recent changes
  2. ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical decisions, critical context, system design
  3. SESSION_NOTES.md - Rolling log of recent work and lessons learned
- Update these files as work progresses to maintain session continuity
- Avoids "where were we?" token waste by preserving 2+ months of context
