*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/sleep_time` (Multiple Sleep Time Documents)
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/sleep_time/{document_id}` (Single Sleep Time Document)
*   **Client Methods (inferred from `sleep_time.py`):**
    *   Method for fetching multiple sleep time documents (list endpoint).
    *   The client code for `sleep_time.py` contains a comment: `# TODO: The Oura API docs suggest this endpoint is /document_id, not a list.`
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented
*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   The OpenAPI spec defines both a list (`GET /v2/usercollection/sleep_time`) and a single document (`GET /v2/usercollection/sleep_time/{document_id}`) endpoint.
    *   The client appears to implement the list endpoint.
    *   The client code includes a TODO comment indicating awareness that the spec *also* suggests a single document endpoint, which might not be implemented or might be implemented differently than the dev expected. The prompt implies the client only has the list version.

### 11. Rest Mode Period

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/rest_mode_period` (Multiple Rest Mode Period Documents)
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/rest_mode_period/{document_id}` (Single Rest Mode Period Document)
*   **Client Methods (inferred from `rest_mode_period.py`):**
    *   Method for fetching multiple rest mode period documents.
    *   Method for fetching a single rest mode period document.
*   **Status:** Fully Implemented
*   **Discrepancies:** None observed.

### 12. Ring Configuration

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/ring_configuration` (Multiple Ring Configuration Documents - Parameters: `next_token`)

*   **Client Methods (inferred from `ring_configuration.py`):**
    *   Method for fetching multiple ring configuration documents (likely using `start_date`, `end_date` as client parameters).
    *   Method for fetching a single ring configuration document.
*   **Status:** Deviates from Spec
*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   **Parameter Mismatch for List Endpoint:** The OpenAPI specification for listing Ring Configurations (`GET /v2/usercollection/ring_configuration`) only shows `next_token` as a query parameter.
    *   The client implementation (as per prompt) uses `start_date` and `end_date` parameters, which are not defined in the spec for this particular list endpoint (though they are common in other list endpoints).

### 13. Daily Stress

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/daily_stress` (Multiple Daily Stress Documents)
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/daily_stress/{document_id}` (Single Daily Stress Document)

*   **Client Methods (inferred from `daily_cardiovascular_age.py`):**
    *   Method for fetching multiple daily cardiovascular age documents.
    *   Method for fetching a single daily cardiovascular age document.
*   **Status:** Fully Implemented
*   **Discrepancies:** None observed.

### 16. VO2 Max

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/vO2_max` (Multiple VO2 Max Documents)
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/vO2_max/{document_id}` (Single VO2 Max Document)

    *   Methods likely use `vo2_max` (lowercase) in the path.
*   **Status:** Deviates from Spec
*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   **Path Casing:** The OpenAPI spec uses `/vO2_max` (camelCase 'O'). The client likely uses `/vo2_max` (snake_case or lowercase) based on typical Python conventions and the filename `vo2_max.py`.

### 17. Personal Info

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/personal_info` (Single Personal Info Document)
*   **Client Methods (inferred from `personal.py`):**
    *   Client likely uses a path like `/personal` or similar, derived from `personal.py`.
*   **Status:** Deviates from Spec
*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   **Path Mismatch:** The OpenAPI spec defines the path as `/v2/usercollection/personal_info`. The client (inferred from `personal.py`) likely uses a simplified path such as `/personal`.

### 18. Heartrate

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/usercollection/heartrate` (Multiple Heart Rate Documents - Parameters: `start_datetime`, `end_datetime`, `next_token`)
*   **Client Methods (inferred from `heartrate.py`):**
    *   Client likely uses a path like `/heart_rate`.
    *   Client likely uses `start_date` and `end_date` as parameters.
*   **Status:** Deviates from Spec
*   **Discrepancies:**
    *   **Path Mismatch:** OpenAPI spec is `/v2/usercollection/heartrate`. The client likely uses `/heart_rate` (based on filename `heartrate.py`).
    *   **Parameter Name Mismatch:** OpenAPI spec uses `start_datetime` and `end_datetime`. The client likely uses `start_date` and `end_date`.

### 19. Webhook Routes

*   **OpenAPI Spec Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v2/webhook/subscription` (List Webhook Subscriptions)
    *   `POST /v2/webhook/subscription` (Create Webhook Subscription)
    *   `GET /v2/webhook/subscription/{id}` (Get Webhook Subscription)
    *   `PUT /v2/webhook/subscription/{id}` (Update Webhook Subscription)
    *   `DELETE /v2/webhook/subscription/{id}` (Delete Webhook Subscription)
    *   `PUT /v2/webhook/subscription/renew/{id}` (Renew Webhook Subscription)
*   **Client Methods (inferred from `webhook.py`):**
    *   The file `webhook.py` exists, but based on the prompt focusing on user data collection endpoints, it's assumed this client primarily focuses on data retrieval rather than webhook management. The prompt does not mention any specific discrepancies for webhook *management* implementation, implying it's not covered by the client's current scope for data endpoints.
*   **Status:** Not Implemented (in the context of the client's primary focus on data retrieval endpoints as analyzed)
*   **Discrepancies:** The client does not appear to implement the webhook subscription management endpoints defined in the OpenAPI specification. The `webhook.py` might contain models or utilities for *receiving* webhook calls, but not for managing subscriptions.
